```shortuuid``` is a simple php library that generates concise, unambiguous, URL-safe UUIDs.

Often, one needs to use non-sequential IDs in places where users will see them, but the IDs must be as concise and easy 
to use as possible. shortuuid solves this problem by translating generated uuids to base57 using lowercase and uppercase 
letters and digits, and removing similar-looking characters such as l, 1, I, O and 0.

This library is a port of it's python counter-part by Stochastic Technologies: https://github.com/stochastic-technologies/shortuuid
